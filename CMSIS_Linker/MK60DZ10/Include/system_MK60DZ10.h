**
**     Revisions:
**     - rev. 1.0 (2011-06-10)
**         Initial version.
**         Changes with respect to the previous MK60NxxxMD100 header file:
**         RTC  - CCR register removed. Replaced by IER register.
**         CRC  - added CTRLHU register for 8-bit access to the CTRL register.
**         FB   - bit FB_CSCR_EXALE renamed to FB_CSCR_EXTS.
**         SIM  - bit group FSIZE in SIM_FCFG1 split into groups PFSIZE and NVMSIZE.
**         I2S  - bit SSIEN in I2S_CR register renamed to I2SEN.
**         SDHC - bit VOLTSEL in SDHC_VENDOR register removed.
**     - rev. 1.1 (2011-06-29)
**         Order of declarations changed.
**     - rev. 1.2 (2011-09-08)
**         Cortex_Core_Configuration extended with additional parameters.
**         Gap between end of interrupt vector table and flash configuration field filled by default ISR.
**     - rev. 1.3 (2012-01-10)
**         Registers updated according to the new reference manual revision - Rev. 6, 6 Nov 2011
**         ADC - PGALPb bit group added.
**         PDB - Register PO)EN renamed to POEN
**         SDHC - WRBRSTLEN bit group added
**         SIM - Bit DSPI0 in SCGC6 register renamed to SPI0.
**     - rev. 1.4 (2012-04-13)
**         Added new #define symbol MCU_MEM_MAP_VERSION_MINOR.
**         Added new #define symbols <peripheralType>_BASE_PTRS.
**     - rev. 1.5 (2013-04-05)
**         Changed start of doxygen comment.
